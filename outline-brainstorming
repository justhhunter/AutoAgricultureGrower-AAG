Hunter: I personally prefer hydroponics as it will mean alot more setup and work which is fun for me.
I also think that soil will end up being too easy? also heavy because if you wanna move it you can dump the water
but transporting soil is a bitch.



hydroponics or regular soil?

hydroponic
pros:
cleaner
more control over nutrients
many variables so = fun engineering challenge
shorter grow times
less prone to disease or pests

cons:
can be more expensive depending on how we do it
hydroponics are not considered organic
many many variables to control IE temp, nutrients, acidity.. possibly more


regular
pros:
really straight forward
less sensors/work basically

cons:
dirtier
replacement of soil
slower
more prone to disease or pests

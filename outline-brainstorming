hydroponic
Technique: Deep water culture


roots of the plants are submerged in water. to make sure the plants
do not drown, air is pumped into the water witha  air pump and air stone
to provide oxygen

the water needs to be nutrient rich
needs ph, temp, and nutrient density to be maintained and consistent


SUMMARY:
We do not need to worry about the temp since its Arizona. We just need sensors for the pH and nutrient density or EC (electrical conductivity).
We also need a air pump and a small motor to run that. Another harder to get item will be the air stone? We could try other things, but I have 
heard that its a good choice.

hydroponic
pros:
cleaner
more control over nutrients
many variables so = fun engineering challenge
shorter grow times
less prone to disease or pests

cons:
can be more expensive depending on how we do it
hydroponics are not considered organic
many many variables to control IE temp, nutrients, acidity.. possibly more





Technique: Deep water culture


roots of the plants are submerged in water. to make sure the plants
do not drown, air is pumped into the water witha  air pump and air stone
to provide oxygen

the water needs to be nutrient rich
needs ph, temp, and nutrient density to be maintained and consistent
